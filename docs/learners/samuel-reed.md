## About Me
- **Name:** Samuel Reed  
- **Affiliation:** University of Minnesota Institute on the Environment (starting new position at Friends of the Boundary Waters on 9/29)
- **Email:** reed0632@umn.edu 

## Research Interests

My research focus is focused on disturbance in eastern temperate forests. During graduate school I researched how multiple, compounding disturbances (deer+fire+treefall) can lead to major changes in forest plant and earthworm communities, particularly in the Northwoods. During my postdoc, I did a content analysis all of the Northeast and Midwest State Forest Action Plans for their disturbance strategies and how prepared states are for multiple disturbances and the potential state shifts that might occur. Additionally, I have been focused on how companies can better integrate biodiversity into their sustainability plans.

## Fun Fact
I have done research on an island off the coast of Quebec where the folks living there have practically domesticated deer.
